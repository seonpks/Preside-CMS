## Introduction

PresideCMS provides a built-in forms system which allows you to define user-input forms that can be used throughout the admin and in your application's front-end.

Forms are defined using xml files that live under a `/forms` directory. A typical form definition file will look like this:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<form i18nBaseUri="form.my-form:">
    <tab id="basic" sortorder="10">
        <fieldset id="basic" sortorder="10">
            <field binding="my_obj.my_field"      sortorder="10" />
            <field binding="my_obj.another_field" sortorder="20" />
        </fieldset>
    </tab>
    <tab id="advanced" sortorder="20" permissionkey="advancedsettings.edit">
        <fieldset id="advanced" sortorder="10">
            <field binding="my_obj.advanced_option" sortorder="10" />
        </fieldset>
    </tab>
</form>
```

An example admin render of a form with multiple tabs and fields might look like this:

### Referencing forms

Forms are referenced relative to their location under the `/forms` directory of either your application or extension. Slashes in the relative path are replaced with dots (`.`) and the file extension is removed. For example:

```luceescript
// form definition location:
/application/forms/eventsmanager/create.event.xml

// form ID
"eventsmanager.create.event"

// example usage
var formData = event.getCollectionForForm( "eventsmanager.create.event" );
```

>>>> The Preside forms system is not to be confused with the [[formbuilder|PresideCMS Form builder]]. The form builder is a system in which content editors can produce dynamically configured forms and insert them into content pages. The Preside Forms system is a system of programatically defining forms that can be used either in the admin interface or hard wired into the application's front end interfaces.
